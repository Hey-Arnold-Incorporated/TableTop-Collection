6,342900,"Earthborne Rangers","Earthborne Rangers is a customizable, co-operative card game set in the wilderness of the far future. You take on the role of a Ranger, a protector of the mountain valley you call home: a vast wilderness transformed by monumental feats of science and technology devised to save the Earth from destruction long ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You begin by building a deck that reflects your Ranger's interests, personal history, and personality. Then, as you explore the open world and your story takes shape, you augment your deck with improved equipment, refined skills, and the memories of your journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story of Earthborne Rangers is presented as a branching narrative campaign consisting of a main storyline and a multitude of side stories. In it, you can choose to follow the critical path or to strike off on your own to discover the Valley's many engaging characters, mysterious ruins, and beings both familiar and strange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game session represents one day in the Valley, and you'll pick up in the same location on the map where you rested the night before. Your goal is to either complete one of your available missions or to explore the open world. The session ends when you're either forced to rest (through either fatigue or injury), or you choose to rest for the night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An individual game session is played in rounds, and those rounds consist of turns. On your turn, you perform one action: either play a card from your hand, or choose an action from a card on the table. Each action allows you to interact thematically and narratively with the world, and each time you take an action, the world comes to life around you. Predators stalk their prey, rain pours from the sky, rocks tumble down the mountain to block your path, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,4,60,240,12,3.2353,2023,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342900/earthborne rangers"

8,396790,"Nucleum","When Elsa von Fr&amp;uuml;hlingfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called &amp;ldquo;atomization.&amp;rdquo; Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power, demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony&amp;rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial revolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear reactor).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players earn victory points by developing their networks, building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving them special powers when unlocked.

15,224517,"Brass: Birmingham","Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass.

War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis &amp;ndash; Dune, the desert planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dune: Imperium uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many deck-building games, you don&amp;rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&amp;rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&amp;rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&amp;rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards.

18,162886,"Spirit Island","In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,4,90,120,13,4.0624,2017,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit island"

20,183685,"Mr. President: The American Presidency, 2001-2020","Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States. It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game, where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda, and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a &amp;quot;different every game&amp;quot; story, you'll either be thinking &amp;quot;POTUS? Piece of Cake!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Why was it that I WANTED this job?&amp;quot; many times in each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like the actual President, you'll have an array of allies and resources to help you as you navigate both the corridors of power in the nation's capital and the uncertainties of international relations. These allies and resources will vary from game to game, but you'll always be able to rely on your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to help you with foreign policy and with the use, where you deem necessary, of the combat power of the U.S. military. You'll also have a bevy of domestic advisors and friends in Congress to help you navigate the many challenges in Congress and domestic life and politics. And you'll always have access to at least one truly exceptional talent (this, too, will vary from game to game), someone who excels in their particular job and is a &amp;quot;force multiplier&amp;quot; for you in their own unique way. How you lead and utilize this mix of talents and experience at your disposal will go a long way toward determining your success or failure during your shot at being Mr. President.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Game Play&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Map. The game map allows you to see and track the domestic and world situation that the game creates. It is divided into sections:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Congress. This is where you track progress of legislation, as well as keep track of your friends and opponents in Congress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Advisors and Assets. This section of the map is a holding area for all of your advisors, available action points, and military assets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Crisis Management. This is where you manage the Crisis Cards and keep track of crisis status and how well you've dealt with each crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The World portion of the map (about half of the map) is divided into eight world regions, with additional sections for Russia and China (your key potential antagonists in the game). Here's a look at the South America Region, as an example of the regional displays:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crisis Cards. At the heart of Mr. President are the 150+ Crisis Cards that help create the storyline for each game. These cards - see the 12 sample cards on this page - are a mix of cards representing Domestic or World Crises, Terrorism Events, Unexpected Benefits, and Opportunities. The Crisis Cards help drive, but do not completely control, the storyline in each game. Here's how it works:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each game of Mr. President is divided into eight turns, each representing six months in office. These turns are further divided into six Rounds, each representing one month.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of each turn, you get to perform assessment and planning actions, where you get to lay out your rough plan, re-examine strategy, re-evaluate the threats and opportunities that were presenting as the previous turn ended (or at game start). So there is definitely a proactive strategy piece to the game. Unfortunately, though, your plans are not often going to survive intact once the turn gets going. The world stage is a dynamic platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have your plans made (and the Mr. President gods laugh at you!), you perform the six monthly rounds in order. During each round, you draw three Crisis Cards that represent that main world or domestic events that happen (these are usually bad from your point of view, but occasionally they are events or resources that help you) during that month. Most of the events on the Crisis Cards present you with both an urgent problem that may immediately alter the board state, and a longer term issue that may linger and cause you pain down the road if you don't address it well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you flip and resolve the three Crisis Cards for the round, you get to take actions, using any of your available personnel and resources. These actions allow you  to make progress on your legislative agenda, attempt to address any new crises presented by the round's three actions cards, deal with any lingering world or domestic issues, fight terrorism, perform diplomacy, and attempt to better your situation in the world or in the eyes of the American people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you finish your action portion of the round, that round (month) is finished, and you move on to the next round, drawing three new Crisis Cards and repeating the round process until the 6-month turn is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeded within the 18-card mix that makes up a turn, you have six cards for Russian and Chinese Actions, Terror Actions, War Progress, Crisis Checks, and White House Life. You know that each of these six cards will show up sometime during each turn, but you don't know when. The variable timing of these cards' appearance each turn adds uncertainty and spice to the game, while ensuring that major players in the game present challenges for you every single turn. Russia and China offer deeper challenges, with four possible postures (aggression levels) for each country and a country-specific AI for each. Postures may shift in-game in response to your actions or to storyline events, making dealing positively with each nation an evolving challenge all game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that Mr. President is NOT a &amp;quot;beer and pretzels&amp;quot; surface-level game. This game is intended to be deep and immersive, one that will both frustrate and delight the solitaire player. Playing time is four to eight hours (depending on your experience level) to play an entire 4-year term. I've tried to pack as much fun as possible into each 6-month turn, so that even if you only have time to play one turn on a weeknight, you'll be engaged, frustrated, challenged, and immersed throughout. That said, I hope you're going to find it difficult to stop playing after each turn. I've designed Mr. President to be an experience that will wrap you up in each new game's story, and beckon you back to the game table after each round, turn, or completed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I designed this game to provide massive replayability. With over 150 Crisis cards in the mix, and multiple subsystems representing the US Economy, Congress, Homeland Security, the Press, Presidential Prestige, Russia, China, Hostile Rogue States, and staunch Allies, no two games of Mr. President will ever play remotely alike. If you think you're ready for that challenge, go ahead. Raise your right hand and swear the oath. Then settle in behind the desk in the Oval Office, and let your imagination run wild!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope playing Mr. President brings you as much enjoyment as designing it has brought me!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Gene&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 5&amp;quot; deep Game Box&lt;br/&gt;    One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; mounted game board&lt;br/&gt;    One 22&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; mounted game board&lt;br/&gt;    180 Cards&lt;br/&gt;    500+ counters and markers&lt;br/&gt;    One &amp;quot;How to Play&amp;quot; rulebook&lt;br/&gt;    One &amp;quot;How to Play a Turn&amp;quot; FlipBook&lt;br/&gt;    One Scenario Book&lt;br/&gt;    One World Chart Book&lt;br/&gt;    One Domestic Chart Book&lt;br/&gt;    Two Peer Competitor Action Books for Russia and China&lt;br/&gt;    Six Player Aid cards&lt;br/&gt;    One 10-sided die&lt;br/&gt;    One 6-sided die&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,1,360,600,0,4.2031,2023,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183685/mr. president: the american presidency, 2001-2020"

There, a group of mercenaries at the end of their rope will help bring back this settlement from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but there are other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold as well. There are Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors of machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.

The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay.

You must balance your finances to optimize the various actions provided by the different gods, with each player gaining the support of only one god each turn.

Each player starts with three merchant ships in their port and there are two reinforcements for each player on the island in the middle of the river. Each player rolls four binary dice in order to move their ships along the river, ultimately to the other player's port. If one player's boat lands the other's boat, then they roll to see who wins the battle and whose boat needs to retreat to their original port.

In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters (which are temperature, oxygen, and ocean coverage). However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&lt;br/&gt;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&lt;br/&gt;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&lt;br/&gt;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Build factories with powerful machines. And populate ancient sites to relearn your tribe's forgotten technologies.&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;Revive is a game for 1-4 players with asymmetric player powers, highly variable setup, and no fighting or direct conflict. Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;At the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your turn you take two actions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)&lt;br/&gt;     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)&lt;br/&gt;     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)&lt;br/&gt;     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition you may use power to activate any number of your machines, modifying your actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of taking two actions you may Hibernate. This will circulate your cards, moving your played cards to your resting area, and releasing the cards in your resting area back to you. In addition you regain your used power, so that you may activate your machines again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-use cards play an important role: Each card shows a resource ability (on the top) and a special ability (on the lower part). Playing a card in one of your top slots activates the resource action; In a lower slot you activate the special ability. You may install slot modules in the card slots, and these are activated whenever you play a card matching its color. It is possible to find combinations that lets you chain cards, triggering several slot modules and abilities in one action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building factories harness the power of the surrounding terrains, advancing your marker on one of three machine tracks. This may unlock machines that can be activated, using energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reaching certain milestones lets you take an artifact from the main board.

38,169786,"Scythe","It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &amp;ldquo;The Factory&amp;rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&amp;rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &amp;ldquo;encounter&amp;rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,5,90,115,14,3.4397,2016,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe"

While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.&lt;br/&gt;    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.&lt;br/&gt;    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.&lt;br/&gt;    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.

Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&lt;br/&gt;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories.

Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter.

51,230802,"Azul","Introduced by the Moors, azuleijos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",2,4,30,45,8,1.7615,2017,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul"

53,251247,"Barrage","In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &amp;mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &amp;mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,4,60,120,14,4.0938,2019,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251247/barrage"
54,337627,"Voidfall","For centuries, the Novarchs, descendants of the royal House of Novarchon, have ruled with an iron fist over the feudalistic galactic empire of humankind, the Domineum. During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach &amp;mdash; and eventually inhabit &amp;mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode &amp;mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",1,4,90,240,15,4.4559,2023,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/337627/voidfall"

Using themes from all your favorite giant mecha shows, it takes elements from popular tabletop wargames and streamlines them to make a game with the same depth of strategy without the high learning curve, distance measuring and long play times. Players build teams out of five robots to duke it out against other players' teams of five. It's designed to be easy to learn, affordable to buy, and quick to play, setting it apart from other strategy games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five different classes of robot: Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support, and dozens of robots in each of those Classes. Each Class has its own way of playing and interacting with other bots, and you can make a team out of any five of them for an infinite amount of possible strategies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main mechanism of the game is teambuilding. Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn. Certain compatible robots can combine into greater forms, too!
