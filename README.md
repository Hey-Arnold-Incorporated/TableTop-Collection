# TableTop-Collection

Git Flow
1. Make your own branch
2. Before committing, make sure to pull from main to get the most up-to-date repository
3. Commit and push to the branch every time there is progress without any errors (after every feature is done)
4. After submitting pull request, ask for approval from two other teammembers before merging into main branch
